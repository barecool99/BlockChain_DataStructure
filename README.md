# BlockChain_DataStructure

Blockchain discription:

Blochain consits of (you wouldn't believe it but) blocks. Blocks consit of transcation(For e.g: me paying you 1 BTC). Blocks are connected via hashing(SHA-256).

#To create unique digital fingerprint: transcation + previous blocks fingerprint

#First Block is called "Genesis Block", idk why they make it sound scifi fancy, just call it first block bro

#block interlink each other and even minor changes affect whole block hence keeping blockchain pure(intergrity innit)
