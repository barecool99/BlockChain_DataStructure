# BlockChain_DataStructure

Blockchain discription:

Blochain consits of (you wouldn't believe it but) blocks. Blocks consit of transcation(For e.g: me paying you 1 BTC). Blocks are connected via hashing(SHA-256).

To create unique digital fingerprint: transcation + previous blocks fingerprint

First Block is called "Genesis Block", idk why they make it sound scifi fancy, just call it first block bro

Block interlink each other and even minor changes affect whole block hence keeping blockchain pure(intergrity innit)

For my understanding I doing person A sent to person B as transactions but in real life there will be transcation objects instead

This is basic of it, we don't have networking and mining stack behind it yet :)
